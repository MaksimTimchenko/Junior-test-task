# Junior-test-task
In this test task, I developed a browser extension for Chrome.
Extension must load itself into every page and handle actions on
1. Input elements (type: “text”).
2. Contenteditable elements (including divs)
3. Handle cursor movements with arrow keys on keyboard (right - left - up - down arrows);
4. Handle mouse clicking control (show replacement if it should when user clicks on any word);

5. Popup have an ability to choose its background color and save it even after reloading the page. <br>
  a. Right-click the extension icon in the toolbar then select Options. Alternatively, click DETAILS and scroll down the details page and select Extension options.
      There has different button of background's color. Then click a button of a color that you want to set, it updates the popup background color
