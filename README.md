# Junior-test-task
In this test task, I developed a browser extension for Chrome.
Extension must load itself into every page and handle actions on
1. Input elements (type: “text”).
2. Contenteditable elements (including divs)
3. Handle cursor movements with arrow keys on keyboard (right - left - up - down arrows);
4. Handle mouse clicking control (show replacement if it should when user clicks on any word);
